# nft-svg-template

See for converting the image to SVG, Jpg, PNG etc.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image

## TODO's

- Image reader to detect if an image is closer to black / white as a whole
- Inject mock data using the same interface into this example
- Work out how to convert this to an image

## Development

1. Open the `nft-puppeteer` folder. 
2. Run `node index.js`
3. This will output the HTML as an image
4. (TODO) - see if we can output as SVG, PNG, JPG with this library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image
5. Connect this code to the Application interface
6. Inject into the HTML template the text and images from the parameters
